<b> A Quick step by step uSurvey process flow </b>

<b>Step -1</b>

Create new Module or skip this step, if you want to use existing Modules

<b>Step -2</b>

Create new Group or skip this step, if you want to use existing Groups

Create new Listing or skip this step, if you want to use existing Listing or you can Clone existing Listing and rename it. Here we have to observe two things;

Once Listing is created, next <br> 
Create Questions in Listing <br>
If necessary, <br>
Create Looping in questions and <br>
Add Logic to questions. <br>

<b>Step -4</b>

Create a new Survey or you can Clone existing Survey and rename it,<br>
<b>Clone existing Survey</b>: This option duplicates the survey along with the Listing data, and ready to use.

Once a new Survey is created, next <br>
Create Batch or Batches <br>
then Create Questions in Batch <br>
If necessary, <br>
Create Looping in questions and <br> 
Add Logic to questions. <br>
Finally, don’t forget to change the status to Open, via Action Item ‘Open/Close’ for Batch
