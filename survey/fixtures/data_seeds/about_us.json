Since the mid-1990s, the MICS has enabled many countries to produce statistically sound and internationally comparable estimates of a range of indicators in the areas of health, education child protection and HIV/AIDS. MICS findings have been used extensively as a basis for policy decisions            and programme interventions, and for the purpose of influencing public opinion on the situation of            children and women around the world.</p>            <h3>Survey tools</h3>            The MICS survey tools are developed by UNICEF after consultations with relevant experts from various UN            organizations as well as with interagency monitoring groups. UNICEF works closely with other household            survey programmes, in particular the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme, to harmonize survey            questions and modules and to ensure a coordinated approach to survey implementation, with the objective to            provide comparability across surveys and to avoid duplication of efforts.            The survey questionnaires are modular tools that can be adapted to the needs of the country            <h3>Mobile-based Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS)</h3>            UNICEF Uganda has developed a mobile-based tool to work over the USSD technology to collect household-level.            <br/>            The advantage of the mobile-based approach is:            <ul>                <li>                    To ease implementation of a potentially large-scale survey across regions/districts with large number of investigators.</li><li>To ensure a shorter processing time-frame so that data is available for analysis and informed decision-making in real-time </li> <li>To make it possible to deploy remotely to mobiles and track survey work in real time taking advantage of prompt review of data quality thus ensuring a quicker audit and respondent tracking process.</li><li> To allow flexibility to handle new requests and make modification to on-going interviews while investigators are already in the field.</li><li> To make it easier to provide feedback and to exchange information between stakeholders in real time.</li></ul>",
